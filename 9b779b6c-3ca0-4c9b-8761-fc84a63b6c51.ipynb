    "# Video Games Sales Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "You work at the online store \"Ice\" which sells video games from around the world. Data regarding user and expert reviews of games, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data is available from open sources. You need to identify the patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. That way, you can find the games with the most potential and plan their ad campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In front of you is data from 2016. Let's imagine that it is December 2016 and you are planning a campaign for 2017.\n",
    "(Right now, the most important thing for you is to gain experience working with data. It doesn't matter whether you forecast 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or forecast 2027 sales based on data from 2026.).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains abbreviations. ESRB stands for Entertainment Software Rating Board, which is an independent regulatory organization that evaluates game content and gives an age rating such as Teen or Mature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "1. Top 5 platforms. Explain the variations in market share from one region to another.\n",
    "2. Top 5 genres. Explain the difference.\n",
    "3. Does the ESRB rating affect sales in each region?\n",
    "4. Test the hypothesis whether the average user rating of the Xbox One and PC platforms is the same.\n",
    "5. Test the hypothesis whether the average user rating for the Action and Sports genres is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage\n",
    "1. Open a file\n",
    "2. Pre-processing\n",
    "3. Data analysis\n",
    "4. User profiling\n",
    "5. Test the hypothesis\n",
